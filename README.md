# Zoom Clone By El-Mubarak

Just for fun!!!!

This is a zoom clone developed by El-Mubarak.

It is not an exact clone but it has the bare minimum.

Clone the app. Run `npm install`. Run `npm run start`. All from the terminal and viola, the server is started. (obviously you have to have node and npm installed 🤷🏾‍♂️).

Go to the site i.e http://localhost:443, it automatically generates an id.

To share meeting copy the full link with the id in the address bar e.g http://localhost:433/aaaa-bbbb-cccccc.

People who join with the same link would be in the same meeting as you. Enjoy and have fun!!!
